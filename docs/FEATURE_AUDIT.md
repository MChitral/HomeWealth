## Detailed Feature Audits

### 1. ✅ Mortgage Tracking Feature
**Status:** ✅ **Complete - Already Modularized**

**Current State:**
- Main component: ~555 lines (down from 1400+)
- 14 specialized components
- 4 custom hooks
- Well-organized structure

**No Action Required** - This feature serves as the reference implementation.

---

### 2. 🔴 Scenario Editor Feature
**Status:** 🔴 **Critical - Needs Immediate Attention**

**File:** `client/src/features/scenario-management/scenario-editor.tsx`  
**Lines:** ~1360 lines  
**Priority:** **P1 - Highest**

#### Issues Identified

**1. Monolithic Component**
- Single file with 1360+ lines
- Mixes form state, business logic, UI rendering, and data fetching
- Hard to navigate and maintain
- Difficult to test individual parts

**2. Complex State Management**
- Multiple `useState` hooks (15+ state variables)
- Form state mixed with UI state
- Prepayment events state management is complex
- No centralized state management hook

**3. Inline Calculations**
- Payment preview calculations inline
- Amortization table generation inline
- Projection logic mixed with UI

**4. Large Form Sections**
- Multiple tabs (Mortgage, Investments, Emergency Fund, Prepayment Events)
- Each tab has significant form logic
- No component extraction for form sections

**5. Prepayment Events Management**
- Complex CRUD logic for events
- Inline dialogs for add/edit
- Event form state management is verbose

**6. Missing Components**
- No extracted components for:
  - Mortgage strategy form section
  - Investment strategy form section
  - Emergency fund strategy form section
  - Prepayment events list/management
  - Amortization preview table
  - Payment preview card

#### Recommended Modularization Plan

**Phase 1: State & Data Layer**
- Create `useScenarioEditorState` hook
  - Centralize all form state
  - Handle mutations
  - Manage prepayment events state
  - Calculate derived values

**Phase 2: Form Section Components**
- `MortgageStrategySection` - Prepayment split, rate assumptions
- `InvestmentStrategySection` - Expected return, investment split
- `EmergencyFundStrategySection` - EF contribution and reroute
- `PrepaymentEventsSection` - Events list and management

**Phase 3: Preview & Display Components**
- `PaymentPreviewCard` - Current mortgage payment breakdown
- `AmortizationPreviewTable` - Yearly amortization summary
- `ProjectionPreview` - Scenario projection preview

**Phase 4: Dialog Components**
- `PrepaymentEventDialog` - Add/edit prepayment event
- `ScenarioSaveDialog` - Save confirmation with validation

**Phase 5: Layout & Structure**

### 3. 🟡 Dashboard Feature
**Status:** 🟡 **Medium Priority - Could Be Improved**

**File:** `client/src/features/dashboard/dashboard-feature.tsx`  
**Lines:** ~500 lines  
**Priority:** **P2**

#### Issues Identified

**1. Mixed Concerns**
- Data fetching mixed with UI rendering
- Calculation logic inline
- Chart rendering inline

**2. Large Component**
- 500 lines is manageable but could be better
- Multiple sections that could be extracted

**3. Missing Mortgage Selector**
- Always uses first mortgage (from multi-mortgage audit)
- No way to select different mortgage
- Should integrate with global mortgage selection

**4. Inline Helper Components**
- `CurrentStatusStat` and `SummaryItem` defined at bottom
- Should be extracted to separate files

**5. Complex useMemo Calculations**
- Payment preview calculation is complex
- Could be extracted to custom hook

#### Recommended Improvements

**Priority 1: Mortgage Integration**
- Add mortgage selector to dashboard
- Use shared mortgage selection state

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### 1. Multi-Mortgage Support
**Status:** ⚠️ **Incomplete**

**Affected Features:**
- Dashboard (always uses first mortgage)
- Scenario Editor (no mortgage selector)
- Scenario Comparison (may use wrong mortgage)

**Impact:** Users with multiple mortgages cannot properly use these features

**Recommendation:** Implement global mortgage selection context (see `MULTI_MORTGAGE_AUDIT.md`)

---

### 2. State Management Patterns
**Status:** ⚠️ **Inconsistent**

**Current State:**
- Mortgage tracking: Centralized hook (`useMortgageTrackingState`)
- Emergency fund: Centralized hooks (`useEmergencyFundState`, `useEmergencyFundCalculations`)
- Cash flow: Centralized hooks (`useCashFlowState`, `useCashFlowCalculations`)
- Scenario list: Centralized hook (`useScenarioListState`)
- Scenario editor: Multiple `useState` hooks
- Dashboard: Mixed `useState` and `useMemo`

**Recommendation:** 
- Standardize on custom hooks for complex state
- Consider Context API for shared state (mortgage selection)

---

### 3. Form Handling
**Status:** ⚠️ **Mixed Approaches**

**Current State:**
- Some features use `useState` for forms
- No consistent form validation
- No form library usage

**Recommendation:**
- Consider React Hook Form for complex forms
- Create reusable form components
- Standardize validation patterns

---

### 4. Component Reusability
**Status:** ⚠️ **Low**

**Issues:**
- Similar patterns repeated across features
- No shared form components
- No shared calculation hooks

**Recommendation:**
- Create shared component library
- Extract common patterns
- Build reusable hooks

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (P1)
1. **Scenario Editor Modularization** (20-30 hours)
   - Highest impact
   - Most complex component
   - Blocks other improvements

### Phase 2: High-Value Improvements (P2)
2. **Dashboard Improvements** (8-12 hours)
   - Add mortgage selector
   - Extract components
   - Better organization

### Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Improvements
3. **Cross-Cutting Improvements** (10-15 hours)
   - Global mortgage selection
   - Shared component library
   - Form standardization

**Total Estimated Effort:** 38-57 hours

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Maintainability**
   - Average component size < 300 lines
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to locate and modify code
