# Full Integration - In Progress

## Status

Proceeding with Option 1: Full Integration Now

## Approach

Given the file is 707 lines and requires backward compatibility:

1. **Integrate hooks internally** - Use extracted hooks but maintain all exports
2. **Remove duplicate code** - Delete inline code now in hooks  
3. **Keep exports** - All exports maintained for backward compatibility
4. **Clean up later** - Can remove obsolete exports in a follow-up

## Progress

Starting integration now...
